Use command start-pg.sh to start database, ctrl-c to stop it.

If you are running this with computer which is in private use (ie. not a lab 
computer), you could also start and stop database in the background using 
pg_ctl utility, refer to documentation for details.

When it is running, you can connect to database in different terminal with 
command:
    psql

When you need to connect to database from code, use socket in 
/home/hakkajoe/pgsql/sock 
with default database name and no need to give username or password. Please 
do not hardcode this into your code, this connection will only work for you.
